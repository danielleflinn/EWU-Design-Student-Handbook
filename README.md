# EWU-Design-Student-Handbook

### About this Handbook

This handbook was created by one of EWUâ€™s very own Design students with the vision that future students could use it to be inspired, motivated, and guided throughout their time in the EWU Design Program.

The handbook has everything from the first few courses students typically take, to campus and community opportunities for gaining design experience. This book even has tips on landing your first job after graduation!
