# Succeeding

Succeeding in the design program isn’t about getting an “A” or about having the coolest project in the class, it’s about YOU. What are _you_ learning? Which of _your_ goals are you reaching? Are _you_ taking ownership and pride in the work _you_ are doing? With that said, here are some quick tips on how you can meet these goals.

#### **Do the work**

Wait...Why does this sound so familiar? Oh yeah, it's that important we had to mention it twice. To succeed you will need to do the work. Start early, plan ahead and get your work done. Any work you don’t do is a missed opportunity to learn, grow, and increase your skills as a designer. If you push yourself to do you best on every project now, you will have numerous pieces to include in your portfolio. Each project is an opportunity to enhance yourself and set your future self up to succeed in the professional world.

**Iterate**

Design is all about process. Research, Brainstorm, Sketch, Ideate, Refine, and Make. It is through planning and iteration that each project will take shape and become something great; and maybe even something you never thought you could make.

**Communicate**

We’d like to think this is common sense, but in our busy lives, it sometimes is forgotten. Practice good communication with your professors and peers now, as in the workforce this skill is invaluable. Confused about an assignment? Raise your hand in class, email your professor, talk to your classmates. Seek feedback on your projects, before, during, and after. Pitching your projects and ideas helps you process them and can unlock even bigger inspiration. Hearing feedback helps you enhance your eye for design and improve your final work.

**Make an Impact**

Your reputation while in the program is one of your first opportunities to practice professionalism. Start thinking now about how you want to be seen and work toward that image. Do you want to be remembered as hard-working? Creative? Artistic? A leader? Your peers and professors now will be your first circle of professionals after graduation. Who knows; they might assist you in landing your first job. Be the best version of you that you can be, in your work, in your actions, and in your character.

**Creative Block**

As a creative, sometimes it is hard to be creative. Your “creative juices” might run out or maybe you are just plain unmotivated. Whatever the reason, you find yourself struggling with an assignment, the best way to get over the block is to just sit down and start. Make something. It might turn out horrible, but it is _something._ It is a start. Then take a break and work on something else, go for a walk or get a coffee. Get out and away from your work. Then come back and research what others have done. One of the best ways to create is to remix pieces others have made into something new and uniquely _you._ Research other things that may not even relate to the project but that inspire you. Ask yourself how you could incorporate this into the project. If none of this works, think about what made you want to be a designer. Then write that in giant letters above your workspace. Put it on your phone screen, set is as your desktop background. Shoot, make yourself stickers and tag campus with it.

**Passion Projects**

Having your own design projects outside the classroom is important. These personal projects not only give you a break from structured assignments and the stress of “being right/perfect”. But they offer you an opportunity to practice what you are learning on your own. You are in charge of what you are making, how you are making it, and how long it will take you. Once you are looking to enter the industry, employers will seek passionate people with personal side projects in their portfolios. They want to see projects that show your personal interests, the level of work you are capable of, and your willingness to try and learn new things.

**Your Portfolio**

As a designer, you will need a portfolio to showcase your very best work. Don’t worry about setting one up right away. But as soon as you have taken a quarter of design classes, it is a good idea to start curating your work. The more practice you have designing and building your portfolio, the better it will be. Start now so you can update it as you learn and become a stronger designer. Having a portfolio will help you market yourself and create opportunities for you to gain professional experience.

You might be thinking, “_I can’t have a portfolio, my work isn’t good enough.”_ Stop it. Confidence in yourself is key. If there is work you are proud of, it deserves to be in a portfolio. If you are unsure of what work to use, talk to your peers and program faculty to gain insight and advice on your work. Consider revising some of your weaker projects to make them stronger pieces.

For each project you include in your portfolio, it is important to describe the problem you were trying to solve and your approach to the solution. For example, for a branding project include something like, “A local brewery needed a logo and brand identity documentation to encompass their unique mountain malt flavors and hipster style.” From here, describe your approach and process during the project. Then end with a conclusion stating why your solution works \(or doesn’t work\), what you learned, and if there is anything you would do differently.
