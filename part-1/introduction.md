## **What even is Design?**

Milton Glaser, an industry renowned designer, marketer, and business professional, says

> "To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master."

Design is communicating, and graphic design \(which is visually communicating\) is just one aspect of design. Design is problem-solving, storytelling, entertaining, marketing, advertising, and more.

## Fretting About the Future

There are numerous career paths you can pursue with a Design degree. You can be a Graphic Designer, Print Specialist, Marketing Expert, Entrepreneur, Digital Designer, Artist, Teacher, UX Designer, Web Designer, Social Media Designer, Experiential Designer, Event Planner, Set Designer. The sky isn't even the limit!

All of the possibilities with a design degree might seem overwhelming, so we encourage you to use the time you have now to explore the different avenues and aspects of design. Take classes that interest _you_. Talk to people you know and read about designers. Reach out to local experts. Most people are thrilled to talk to someone about their life \(people like talking about themselves\). Visit the EWU Career Center for resources on conducting an informational interview with an industry professional. Part of your education is discovering what you want for your life, and the best way to do this is to observe and experiment with different roles yourself.

## Tailoring Your Life

The EWU Design Degree is a fairly general start for your design journey. However, you can tailor the degree to fit your interests and career goals. You will work with your faculty advisor to choose classes to fulfill degree requirements and electives while also building specialized skills in a design area _you_ are interested in.

## Choosing a Side Hustle

If you are interested in declaring a double major or minoring in a subject related to design, consider the following options. Then talk with your design advisor about how a minor or second major can help you reach your career goals. Below is a list of options that complement a design degree well.

[**Psychology**    
](https://www.ewu.edu/css/psychology/)Psychology is a great option to study along with design, as in the design field there is a lot of overlap with interpreting how your audience will respond to a design. The visual information processing and cognition classes would be extra beneficial.
