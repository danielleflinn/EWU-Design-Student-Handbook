# Getting Settled

**Courses and Schedule**

The first few classes Design students typically take set the foundation for beginning your journey as a visual designer and communicator.

* Drawing for Communications \(DESN 100\)
* Digital Foundations \(DESN 216\)
* Visual Thinking \(DESN 200\)

Then, continuing to build on this foundation, students usually take:

* History of Design \(DESN 259\)
* Typography 1 \(DESN 243\)
* Design 1 \(DESN 263\)

Your faculty advisor will work with you each quarter to help set your class schedule. It is recommended that you look at the course catalog and schedule before meeting with your advisor. Draft a proposed schedule, then talk with them to make sure you did not miss anything important. Remember, professors have a lot going on especially during enrollment periods. You are encouraged to meet with your advisor early and often.

**Learning environment**

EWU values student learning and success. Because much of the design in the “Real World” are projects, a lot of the work assigned in the Design program is project-based. There are exercises, readings, and occasionally tests and quizzes. But the main work you will be asked to complete will be design-related projects.

**Do the Work**

The EWU design department bases final grades primarily on effort. So DO THE WORK. Work ahead, if you have time, as toward the end of the quarter assignments tend to pile up.

**The “F Words” \(FEAR of FAILURE\)**

FEAR of FAILURE. Just don’t. Don’t be afraid to fail. And don’t be afraid to try something new. Challenge yourself in your work and grow from it. Put your best effort into your work and don’t be afraid to ask for help if you are struggling. Often, students will collaborate together on how they are approaching the same project. Take these opportunities to ask questions and listen to peer feedback. The more effort you put into your work the better it will be, and the more you will learn. Sometimes this might even mean starting over. Iteration is all part of the design process. But once you have a clear vision, your hard work and effort will show in your final draft.
